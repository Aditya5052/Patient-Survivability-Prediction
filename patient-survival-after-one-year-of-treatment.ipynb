    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "A hospital in the province of Greenland has been trying to improve its care conditions by looking at historic survival of the patients. They tried looking at their data but could not identify the main factors leading to high survivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are the best data scientist in Greenland and they've hired you to solve this problem. Now you are responsible for developing a model that will predict the chances of survival of a patient after 1 year of treatment (Survived_1_year).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset & Data Description\n",
    "The dataset contains the patient records collected from a hospital in Greenland. The \"Survived_1_year\" column is a target variable which has binary entries (0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Survived_1_year == 0, implies that the patient did not survive after 1 year of treatment\n",
    "*  Survived_1_year == 1, implies that the patient survived after 1 year of treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the dataset in your jupyter notebook, use the below command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "pharma_data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/pharma_data/Training_set_advc.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  ID_Patient_Care_Situation: Care situation of a patient during treatment\n",
    "*  Diagnosed_Condition: The diagnosed condition of the patient\n",
    "*  ID_Patient: Patient identifier number\n",
    "*  Treatment_with_drugs: Class of drugs used during treatment\n",
    "*  Survived_1_year: If the patient survived after one year (0 means did not survive; 1 means survived)\n",
    "*  Patient_Age: Age of the patient\n",
    "*  Patient_Body_Mass_Index: A calculated value based on the patient’s weight, height, etc.\n",
    "*  Patient_Smoker: If the patient was a smoker or not\n",
    "*  Patient_Rural_Urban: If the patient stayed in Rural or Urban part of the country\n",
    "*  Previous_Condition: Condition of the patient before the start of the treatment ( This variable is splitted into 8 columns - A, B, C, D, E, F, Z and Number_of_prev_cond. A, B, C, D, E, F and Z are the previous conditions of the patient. Suppose for one patient, if the entry in column A is 1, it means that the previous condition of the patient was A. If the patient didn't have that condition, it is 0 and same for other conditions. If a patient has previous condition as A and C , columns A and C will have entries as 1 and 1 respectively while the other column B, D, E, F, Z will have entries 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 respectively. The column Number_of_prev_cond will have entry as 2 i.e. 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2 in this case. )"

    "**Ans:** Because our model has been trained on certain format of data and if we don't provide the testing data of the similar format, the model will give erroneous predictions and the accuracy/f1 score of the model will decrease. Also, if the model was build on 'n' number of features, while predicting on new test data you should always give the same number of features to the model. In this case if you provide different number of features while predicting the output, your ML model will throw a **ValueError** saying something like **'number of features given x; expecting n'**. Not confident about these statements? Well, as a data scientist you should always perform some experiment and observe the results."
